  <p>"I know at times it seems like the world is against us, how everything that we want we sometimes can’t seem to get, & no matter how much preparation and work we do to obtain it’s as if we can never gain it, then in some rare occasions when we do grasp it’s as if we never did by how fast we lose it or it breaks before us.<br>
     That begins us questioning why does this always happen to us? Although our problems seem deep and so worrisome they are often materialistic.<br>
      We see what others have and want not looking back at our belongings & blessings upon us and how others looking out can see & want what we have even if their just necessities.<br>
      The house that we have that we take for granted just because it’s not the one in our dreams, the car that we drive that we don’t want just because it’s not the current year and up to speed, the clothes that we have on our back that we call old and last years fashion, are what some people would gladly take just to fill one of there basic needs.<br>
       Every day that we wake up the ability to move our legs and arms is what some people dream of. The freedom that we take for granted to go anywhere we want is what others wish they could receive. The breath that we take in the morning before waking up and moving one step closer to our dreams.<br>
        Just look back at your life from another person's perspective and your see what you have done and how you live is how some people wish they could achieve.<br>
        So before you speak about the bad of what’s going on in your life and the things you wish you had / or you could do because of what you have seen be grateful for what you do have and the things that you can do because the one who is appreciative will always gain more than the one who is never satisfied with the blessings that he receives.
