  <p>"What if I was to tell you that what you consume in your body could affect the way you think & feel, did you know that according to multiple studies that a diet with high refined sugars can cause impaired brain functions. This can be hard to grasp especially when some people get away from situations like a breakup, for example, could be a bucket of ice cream, not only are you picking up a dangerous amount of calories that’ll take a whole day to shred off, but it also affects your mental health as you will learn from further reading. Such foods that are low in nutritional value although they provide a temporary energy boost eventually come back down and take away twice as much as they gave, foods like crackers, bread, & baked goods are examples of this food group along with sugar-sweetened beverages like energy drinks, soda, & coffee. However, there are healthy alternatives for you to choose from like whole vegetables, fruits, cocoa, seafood, beef, chicken, turkey, tofu, beans, eggs, liver, Fat-free and low-fat milk, and 100% juices that are nutrient-dense and proven to give you all the vitamins that your body and mind need to reach its peak potential. Unfortunately, If you eat lots of processed meat, fried food, refined cereals, candy, pastries, and high-fat dairy products, you're more likely to be anxious and depressed. This is why I challenge every reader to the 30-day challenge which I have listed below "
<br>
<br>
* 		No Candy
* 		No Chocolate
* 		No Chips
* 		No Cookies
* 		No Biscuits
* 		No Ice Cream

* 		No Fried Foods
* 		No Sugar
* 		No Alcohol
* 		No Soda
* 		No Store Bought Juice (*100% )
* 		No Protein Bars!
 <br>
<p>"The energy & brain focus that you will gain from this journey will be well rewarded although it might not be easy such temporary changes will bring along great rewards as the saying goes “nothing worth having comes easy”.</p>
